This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: The is Hiphop
+ This project is conducted by Rui Cao rc3208

+ Project summary: It's said that popular music is a reflection of society, an expression of our thoughts, wants, fears, and emotions. Others are of the belief that music is more an expression of artists themseleves. In either case, music can serve as an insight into the human mind in ways that many other mediums cannot. Lyrics and rythms both affect people's mood. Hiphop is a stylized rhythmic music, intinally developed in the United States in 1970s. With hiphop's development, it emerges on the national scene. In 2017, hip-hop has usurped rock as the most consumed and popular musical genre reported by Fores.
